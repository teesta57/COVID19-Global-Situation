### 4. Trends & Growth

* **What it shows:** This page highlights how the pandemic evolved over time, with a focus on new cases, new deaths, and overall growth patterns. It captures the trajectory of the virus month by month and tracks how confirmed, active, recovered, and death counts shifted across WHO regions.
* **Key metrics:** Monthly totals (New Cases, New Deaths), Regional totals (Confirmed, Active, Recovered, Deaths), Weekly mean case growth rate per country, Quarterly trends (Cases, Death %, Recovery %) by WHO region.
* **Visuals:** Line charts tracking new cases & deaths over time, Trend curves (Confirmed vs Recovered vs Deaths by WHO region), Bar charts of weekly growth rate leaders by country, Quarterly plots for Recovery %, Case growth %, Death %.
* **Insights:** This page reveals where surges happened, which countries faced the fastest weekly growth, and how recovery rates evolved relative to death and case growth. It highlights hotspots with alarming acceleration, such as Papua New Guinea and Gambia, while also underscoring strong recovery patterns in certain regions. The quarter-wise perspective shows whether regions are stabilizing, improving, or facing repeated waves, making it critical for identifying both risks and areas of resilience.

### 5. US Focus (County/State)

* **What it shows:** This page dives deep into the US pandemic situation, highlighting confirmed cases and death counts across states and counties. It spotlights where the outbreak has been most severe and which regions have recorded the highest loss of life.
* **Key metrics:** Total confirmed cases by province, Total deaths by province/state, Top 5 states by death count, County-level confirmed cases and deaths.
* **Visuals:** An interactive US map displays confirmed cases by province/state, a trend chart highlights the top five states with the highest death counts over time, and a detailed table lists county-level breakdowns of confirmed cases and deaths with totals aggregated.
* **Insights:** The page reveals that New York leads both in confirmed cases and deaths, with counties like New York, Nassau, and Suffolk dominating the list of hardest-hit regions. States such as New Jersey and Michigan also emerge with significant death tolls, while populous counties like Los Angeles and Cook further highlight urban vulnerability. This breakdown underscores the geographic concentration of the crisis in major metropolitan areas and the regional disparities in impact across the country.
